# MRI Slice-Based Alzheimer's Disease Classification using ResNet50

## Introduction

This project aims to classify MRI brain scans into three diagnostic categories — Cognitively Normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) — using a deep learning approach. We focus on multi-class classification using preprocessed 3D MRI scans from the ADNI dataset. We used 2D axial/sagittal/coronal slices extracted from 3D MRI scans.

### Problem Statement

The goal is to build a multi-class classification model that accurately distinguishes between CN, MCI, and AD.

### Objectives

- Preprocess and augment brain MRI scans to prepare them for deep learning.
- Use entropy-based selection to choose the most informative slices.
- Train a ResNet50 model on the top-entropy slices for multi-class classification.
- Evaluate the model using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Methodology

### Model Architecture

We use a pre-trained ResNet50 architecture with the following modifications:
- Freeze early convolutional layers (`layer1` and `layer2`).
- Fine-tune deeper layers (`layer3`, `layer4`, and `fc`).
- Replace the final fully connected layer with a Dropout + 3-way output layer.

### Training Methodology

- Dataset split: 80% training, 20% validation using stratified sampling.
- Loss function: CrossEntropyLoss with class weights to handle imbalance.
- Optimizer: AdamW with `lr=1e-4` and `weight_decay=1e-4`.
- Learning Rate Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau (based on validation accuracy).
- Early stopping after 5 epochs without improvement.

### Hyperparameters

| Parameter          | Value         |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Slice size        | 112x112       |
| Top-K slices      | 50            |
| Batch size        | 32            |
| Epochs            | 50 (with early stopping) |
| Patience          | 5             |

### Data Augmentation

- Random horizontal flip
- Random rotation (±15 degrees)
- Color jittering (brightness, contrast)
- Random affine transformations (small translations)

### How to Train & Evaluate

1. Run the notebook end-to-end (Kaggle / Colab / Local).
2. Ensure preprocessed MRI slices are in NIfTI format inside `Preprocessed_ADNI_flat`.
3. Output: best model weights and classification report.
